- Hi These are our codes
- [return to homepage](https://github.com/ronineume/X-NLP-Project)
- Before run the following codes, please make sure you found data in Datasets folder and run [DataClean&Pre.ipynb](https://github.com/ronineume/X-NLP-Project/blob/main/Data_preparation/DataClean%26Pre.ipynb)
- [Sequential tagging](https://github.com/ronineume/X-NLP-Project/blob/main/Codes/SeqTagging.ipynb) You can select some tagged words for further analysis
- [LDA Topic Modeling](https://github.com/ronineume/X-NLP-Project/blob/main/Codes/LDAModel.ipynb) A useful tool for generating topics
- [Word Embedding](https://github.com/ronineume/X-NLP-Project/blob/main/Codes/SemanticVec.ipynb) Visualize embeddings, you can also use it to find vector relationship
- [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/ronineume/X-NLP-Project/blob/main/Codes/Bayes.ipynb) A Naive Bayes Classifier for text Classification
- [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ronineume/X-NLP-Project/blob/main/Codes/Sentiment.ipynb) A BERT Classifier and Results of Word Shift Graphs, need to run Naive Bayes Classifier first.
you may need to prepare PyTorch.
